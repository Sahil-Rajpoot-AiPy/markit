MarkIt - Portable Edition
=========================

What is MarkIt?
---------------
MarkIt is a lightweight desktop app that lets you add a watermark or brand logo
to many images at once. Simple, visual, and safe — your original files are never overwritten.

How to Run
----------
1. Extract this ZIP file somewhere (e.g., Desktop or Downloads).
2. Double-click "MarkIt.exe" to start the app.

Quick Steps in the App
----------------------
1. Select source folder (images to watermark).
2. Select watermark/logo (preferably a transparent PNG).
3. Select output folder (processed images are saved here).
4. Adjust size, transparency, and placement.
5. Preview with "Batch Test".
6. Process all images with "Bulk Processing".
7. Important: If you choose the same folder as the source for the output (or a folder containing the original images or the app's main files), the application will save processed files using the same filenames and will overwrite the originals. To avoid unintended loss, choose a separate output folder or first back up your originals.


System Requirements
-------------------
- Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit recommended)
- May require Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (2015–2022) if not already installed:

First-Run Notes
---------------
- Windows SmartScreen may show "Windows protected your PC".
  Click "More info" → "Run anyway".
- If you see "This file came from another computer":
  Right-click MarkIt.exe → Properties → check "Unblock" → Apply.
- If Windows Defender quarantines the file:
  Restore it and create an exclusion in
  Windows Security → Virus & threat protection → Manage settings → Exclusions.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If the app won't start, be sure you extracted the ZIP before running.
- If you see missing DLL errors, install the Visual C++ Redistributable.
- If the app freezes on certain files, try a smaller sample set or re-export problem images.
